R scripts

Description
This repository provides the R scripts used for Kaplan–Meier survival analyses and related plots described in the manuscript.
To ensure reproducibility of the code structure while protecting patient confidentiality, an example dataset with simulated values is included.

Repository Structure
scripts/ – R scripts for survival analysis and plotting.
data/ – Example dataset (example_dataset.csv) with mock data (not real patients).
results/ – Example figures generated with the mock dataset.

Data Availability
The R code is openly available in this repository.
The original patient-level data cannot be shared due to ethical and privacy restrictions.
Data supporting the findings are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

How to Use
Clone or download this repository.
Open the R scripts inside scripts/.
Use the provided example dataset (example_dataset.csv) to reproduce the figures.
To replicate the study results, replace the example dataset with your own data structured with the same column names.
